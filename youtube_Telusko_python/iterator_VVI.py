# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__() .

# Point to be noted that iterator is an object.

# remember , list is not an iterator, you need to convert it to an iterator to iterate.
