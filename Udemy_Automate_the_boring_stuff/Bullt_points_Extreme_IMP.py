# 'sep' in print function

# by default string will do sorting in asciibetical rule, but you can change it by changing the key.

list1 = ['A', 'D', 'k', 'a', 'b']

(list1.sort())
print(list1)
(list1.sort(key=str.lower))
print(list1)

# remember, list normal copy will always be shalow copy.



# order matters for list and tuples but not for dictionaries and sets

print([1, 2, 3] == [3, 2, 1])


# get and setdefault method in dictionary.
# note that there is not set method, it is setdefault method. also it is used to check the keys, if the key exists, it will not change the value , but only if the key does not exists then it will add it.

# so it is basically add,  not change .

# This above is extremely important.

# in case of a blank string, both isUpper and isLower method returns False., alos it holds tru for any sting that does not contain any character.

# isalpha, isalnum, isspace, isdecimal, istitle

# startswith, endswith

# split, join, zip

# replace method
